# Assumption

1. Solving the problem is required, but an application easy to understand, and maintain is more important
2. The following were a bit too big to fit in this exercise:
    - [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html) for the two `println`
    - [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/) to test the code more thoroughly
    - [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) to parse user input
